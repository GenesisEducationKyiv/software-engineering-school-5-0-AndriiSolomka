## Context

We needed to choose a cloud platform for deploying the service, considering CI/CD, security, scalability, and integration with other services.

## Considered Options

1. **Google Cloud Platform**  
   - **Pros:**  
     - Easy integration with Docker, Kubernetes  
     - Powerful managed services (Cloud SQL, Memorystore, Pub/Sub)  
     - Flexible IAM system, simple CI/CD  
   - **Cons:**  
     - Cost

2. **AWS**  
   - **Pros:**  
     - Largest selection of services  
   - **Cons:**  
     - More complex configuration
     - Less team experience

3. **Azure**  
   - **Pros:**  
     - Integration with Microsoft ecosystem  
   - **Cons:**  
     - Less team experience

## Decision

**Google Cloud Platform** was chosen for deployment and hosting. The decision was based on its seamless integration with Docker and Kubernetes, powerful managed services, and straightforward CI/CD setup. While AWS and Azure offer strong alternatives, GCP best matches the team's experience and project needs for rapid deployment and scalability.

## Consequences

**Positive:**  
- Easy scaling and CI/CD  
- Integration with managed PostgreSQL and Redis  
- Ready for production workloads

**Negative:**  
- Cost
- Vendor lock-in risk (migration to another cloud provider may be complex and expensive)
