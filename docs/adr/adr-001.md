## Context

We needed to choose a backend technology stack for developing the weather subscription service. The main options considered were:
- **Node.js** — JavaScript runtime environment commonly used with frameworks such as Express or NestJS  
- **Go** — a statically typed compiled language with web frameworks like Gin or Echo  
- **PHP** — a widely used scripting language supported by frameworks such as Laravel or Symfony

## Considered Options

1. **Node.js**  
   - **Pros:**  
     - High performance for I/O-bound tasks  
     - Large npm ecosystem  
     - Convenient for REST API development  
     - Active community, modern stack
   - **Cons:**  
     - Single-threaded, requires additional solutions for CPU-bound tasks

2. **Go**  
   - **Pros:**  
     - High performance, easy deployment  
   - **Cons:**  
     - Fewer libraries for web/API  
     - Higher onboarding cost for the team

3. **PHP**  
   - **Pros:**  
     - Easy hosting, large developer pool  
   - **Cons:**  
     - Outdated stack for modern APIs  
     - Fewer options for asynchronous processing

## Decision

**Node.js** was chosen as the main backend platform. The decision was based on the team's strong experience with Node.js, its large ecosystem, and the ability to quickly develop and scale modern REST APIs. Node.js also provides access to a wide range of libraries and tools, which speeds up development and testing.

## Consequences

**Positive:**  
- Fast development with a modern stack  
- Easy scaling and integration with other services  
- Many ready-to-use libraries for integrations and testing

**Negative:**  
- Single-threaded, requires extra solutions for CPU-bound tasks
