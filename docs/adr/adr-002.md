## Context

To develop the backend of the weather subscription service on Node.js, we needed to choose a framework. Key requirements: modularity, scalability, TypeScript support, convenient testing, active community. NestJS, Express, and Fastify were considered. An important factor is that the team has significant experience with NestJS, enabling a fast project start and high code quality.

## Considered Options

1. **NestJS**  
   - **Pros:**  
     - Angular-like architecture (familiar to many developers)  
     - Built-in support for modularity, DI, middleware, pipes, guards  
     - Seamless TypeScript integration  
     - Active community, many ready modules  
     - Team has strong experience with NestJS  
     - Easy integration with modern testing tools (Jest)  
   - **Cons:**  
     - Larger framework size, steeper learning curve for newcomers

2. **Express**  
   - **Pros:**  
     - Minimalistic, easy to use  
     - Huge ecosystem  
   - **Cons:**  
     - No structured architecture out of the box  
     - Need to implement DI, validation, and project structure manually  
     - Less suitable for large team projects

3. **Fastify**  
   - **Pros:**  
     - Higher performance compared to Express  
     - Built-in schema validation  
   - **Cons:**  
     - Fewer middleware and modules  
     - Less clear architecture for large projects  
     - Less team experience

## Decision

**NestJS** was chosen as the main backend framework, as the team has the most experience with it, enabling a fast start, effective support, and project scalability.

## Consequences

**Positive:**  
- Fast project start thanks to team experience with NestJS  
- High code quality and modern best practices  
- Easy project scaling  
- Seamless integration with TypeScript and Jest  
- Strong community support

**Negative:**  
- Larger framework size  
- Steeper learning curve for newcomers
